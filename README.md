# EDA-and-Feature-Engineering-on-Advance-Housing-Price-Dataset

Trying to implement EDA,feature engineering and feature selection techniques for:
<br>
<li>Getting a better understanding of the data</li>
<li>Dealing with numerical data and categorical data</li>
<li>Handling nan values and outliers</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction of the data using lasso regression</li>
<br>
Since the Advance housing price dataset has so many features it helps to test out your skills to understand data and data preprocessing for getting better prediction results.
<br>
I further tried prediction on this dataset using a self built multiclass linearn regression model from scratch using only numpy.
Also tried the SVR model on same using the sklearn library
